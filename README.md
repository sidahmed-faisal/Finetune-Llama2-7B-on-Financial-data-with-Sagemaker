# Fine-tuning LLama2-7b on Financial Data using AWS SageMaker:

## Project Description
- Utilize Amazon Sagemaker and s3 bucket AWS tools to **fine-tune the Meta Llama 2 7B foundation model**.
- This model has been trained for text-generation tasks. The goal is to adapt this model to your selected domain, enhancing its ability to understand and generate domain-specific text.
### Steps:
* Upload the Domain Data to s3 bucket
* Create AWS SageMaker role and attach the required persmission specially the **Fulls3bucketAcceess**

* Fine-tune the model on your chosen dataset using training notebook
* Test and evaluate the model for its responses to domain knowledge and text-generation tasks using evaluation notebook
* Deploy the fine-tuned model
* Test the fine-tuned model on domain-specific knowledge and text generation tasks relevant to your dataset.
